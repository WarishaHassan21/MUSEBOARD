ðŸŽ¨MuseBoard

MuseBoard is a Generative AI project that blends emotion, language, art, and sound into one creative experience.
Itâ€™s designed to explore how technology can express and amplify human emotions through poetry, visuals, and voice.

MuseBoard uses the power of Natural Language Generation, AI-driven Art, and Text-to-Speech Recitation to bring creativity to life.
Simply choose an emotion (like joy, sadness, or hope), pick your language, and let MuseBoard craft:

ðŸŽ­ A poem inspired by that emotion

ðŸŽ¨ An artistic poster visualizing the mood

ðŸŽ§ A recitation of the poem in a natural voice

Itâ€™s more than a project â€” itâ€™s a digital muse that connects human creativity with artificial intelligence.

ðŸ§  Built With

Python â€” Core programming language

Flask â€” Web framework for backend and routing

Groq API â€” For multilingual poem generation

Pillow (PIL) â€” For artistic poster creation

gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) â€” For audio recitation

HTML, CSS â€” For the frontend design

ðŸ’« Vision

MuseBoard aims to bridge emotion and expression using AI â€” turning abstract feelings into tangible art forms.
Itâ€™s a creative playground for poets, designers, and AI enthusiasts alike.
